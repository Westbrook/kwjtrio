	<h2>Band</h2>
	<p>"<strong>THE KARL WALTERS JR TRIO</strong>" is Westbrook Johnson (trombone/ firmament separation), Keegan Schelling (bass and tsunamis), and Matthew Ferry (drums/ volcanic eruptions).  The music of this unique ensemble hearkens back to the touching, grassroots honesty of the Jazz tradition, while peering into the future with childlike, questioning eyes.  The group's clear, improvisational communication brings to life Johnson's solid compositions, in an entertaining evening for fans of all genres.</p><p>

The KWJ Trio <strong>SOUNDS</strong> like two ice cream trucks crashing into eachother at full speed, their refrigerators exploding cake-soft ice cream sandwiches across the neighborhood.</p><p>

The KWJ Trio <strong>FEELS</strong> like your third kiss, the one when your tongue learned that making out is less a mosh pit and more a ballet.</p><p>

The KWJ Trio <strong>TASTES</strong> like croutons, that Trojan Horse of spiced carb indulgence that cleverly infiltrated that holiest of holy health sanctuaries, the salad.</p><p>

A KWJ Trio <strong>LOOKS</strong> like that one night at the neon slot machines when you somehow evaded the bubbling free drinks and dizzying Vegas boob jobs long enough to leave the casino while you were up 17 dollars.</p>
	<p><strong>Matthew Ferry</strong> is a percussionist, composer and vocalist in Brooklyn, NY.  Matthew graduated from Hofstra University in 2007, studying composition with Herbert Deutsch and music for dance with Arthur Solari.  An active composer and accompanist for dance, he has performed with many choreographers including Charles O Anderson, Paul Matteson, Martha Clarke, Stormy Brandenberger, Maxine Steinman, Robin Becker, Dyane Harvey-Salaam and Errol Grimes.  As a vocalist, he has sung with the National Men and Boys Choir, The Milleridge Singers,  Harrisburg Opera Theater.  While in college, Matthew co-founded the GWM Singers in Roslyn, NY.  Since moving to NYC in 2007, Matthew has been a sideman and studio drummer for jazz, rock, and folk bands.  
</p><p>
Matthew is also a dance accompanist for Princeton University, Complexions Ballet, Hofstra University, Limon Dance, Peridance, and ACDFA.  Matthew currently serves on the board of directors of The Guernica Project, is co-founder of the acoustics innovations company MagMa Technologies, and is Administrative Director for the collaborative-arts group VisionIntoArt.</p>
	<p>Trombonist and composer <strong>Westbrook Johnson</strong> made his way to Brooklyn, NY from San Antonio, TX via Vermont where we graduated from Bennington College in 2006.  He's studied trombone with Brian Drye and Josh Roseman, composition with Kitty Brazelton and Allen Shawn and performance theory with Milford Graves and Bruce Williamson.  In 2004 Westbrook began co-leading ensembles presenting original music and in the winter of 2007 he formed <strong>The Karl Walters Jr Trio</strong> as the main outlet for his compositional work.  Recently Westbrook has worked with the Creative Music Workshop of NYC as well as the School for Improvised Music, as well as Jesse Alejandro and the Big Fatt.  He is also active as a web designer/programmer with his company Designs by WJ.</p>
	<p><strong>Keegan Schelling</strong></p>
<p>Growing up in beautiful Western Massachusetts, Keegan first picked up a bass guitar when looking for something to fill the void that was previously occupied by a full time hockey habit, thus beginning down the slope into musicianship. What a slippery slope it was. Before long, he was a member of the group "subject to change". After high school, Keegan was ready to join the group that would become The Karl Walters Jr. Trio and the rest is history. In between gigs, Keegan is a professional bike mechanic, and is a freelance sound engineer.
</p><p>
Plus, he's a rapper. </p>
	<p><strong>John Welsh</strong></p>
	<p>Hailing from Arizona via foreign countries too numerous to count, multi-instrumentalish John Welsh adds the cheeky irreverence of a three armed sideshow performer by way of guitar, melodica and various percussion to the turbulent seas of the Karl Walters Jr Trio.  Listen for his jocularly incidental compositions to enlarge the iron fist with which Karl rules your very existance.</p><p>Currently attending the New School for Jazz studies, Welsh hopes to one day rule the world with minimalist dissonances and unruly facial hair.</p>
