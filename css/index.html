	<p>"<strong>THE KARL WALTERS JR TRIO</strong>" is Westbrook Johnson (trombone/ firmament separation), Keegan Schelling (bass and tsunamis), and Matthew Ferry (drums/ volcanic eruptions).  The music of this unique ensemble hearkens back to the touching, grassroots honesty of the Jazz tradition, while peering into the future with childlike, questioning eyes.  The group's clear, improvisational communication brings to life Johnson's solid compositions, in an entertaining evening for fans of all genres.</p><p>

The KWJ <strong>SOUNDS</strong> like two ice cream trucks crashing into eachother at full speed, their refrigerators exploding cake-soft ice cream sandwiches across the neighborhood.</p><p>

The KWJ <strong>FEELS</strong> like your third kiss, the one when your tongue learned that making out is less a mosh pit and more a ballet.</p><p>

The KWJ <strong>TASTES</strong> like croutons, that Trojan Horse of spiced carb indulgence that cleverly infiltrated that holiest of holy health sanctuaries, the salad.</p><p>

A KWJ <strong>LOOKS</strong> like that one night at the neon slot machines when you somehow evaded the bubbling free drinks and dizzying Vegas boob jobs long enough to leave the casino while you were up 17 dollars.</p>

	<p><strong>Keegan Schelling</strong></p>
<p>Growing up in beautiful Western Massachusetts, Keegan first picked up a bass guitar when looking for something to fill the void that was previously occupied by a full time hockey habit, thus beginning down the slope into musicianship. What a slippery slope it was. Before long, he was a member of the group "subject to change". After high school, Keegan was ready to join the group that would become The Karl Walters Jr. Trio and the rest is history. In between gigs, Keegan is a professional bike mechanic, and is a freelance sound engineer.
</p><p>
Plus, he's a rapper. </p>
